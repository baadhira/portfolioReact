- I completed an internship at a self-learning platform, where I developed frontend applications using React and Next.js, and contributed to backend development with Python and Django.
- I have experience implementing full-scale e-commerce functionalities such as product listing, cart management, and order processing using Django, PostgreSQL, Bootstrap, and jQuery. Additional features included image cropping, product zoom, offers, coupons, sales reports, and admin-side management tools. 
- I also integrated third-party services like PayPal, Razorpay, and Twilio for SMS verification. 
- In other projects, I contributed to Shopify and developed a Jobbee platform with features like authentication, AWS S3 file uploads, and Next.js server-side rendering. Technologies utilized include Django Rest Framework, React.js, Redux, and PayPal API integration.
